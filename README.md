# Loan-Default-Data-Analysis

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive view of loan performance, borrower behavior, and financial risk.
It is divided into three key dashboard views, each focusing on different analytical layers — Loan Overview, Demographics & Financial Profile, and Risk Metrics.

1️⃣ Loan Default & Overview : To analyze loan distribution, borrower income patterns, and default trends over time.

Key KPIs & Visuals:

🔹Loan Amount by Purpose: Shows total loan amounts across Home, Business, Education, Auto, and Other categories — highlighting lending priorities.

🔹Average Income by Employment Type: Compares borrower earnings across employment types to identify income segments most at risk.

🔹Default Rate by Employment Type: Displays how employment stability influences repayment behavior.

🔹Average Loan by Age Group: Evaluates how loan amount changes across Adults, Middle Age, and Senior Citizens.

🔹Default Rate by Year: Tracks year-over-year variations in default percentages to identify economic or policy impacts.

Insight:

🔹Default rates are higher among unemployed and part-time borrowers, while full-time employees are more creditworthy.

🔹Home loans hold the largest share, emphasizing long-term lending trends.

2️⃣ Application Demographics & Financial Profile : To understand how borrower demographics and financial profiles impact loan distribution and risk.

Key KPIs & Visuals:

🔹Median Loan Amount by Credit Score Category: Highlights how creditworthiness affects loan disbursal.

🔹Count of Loans by Education: Evaluates how education level correlates with borrowing activity.

🔹Total Loan Amount (Adults) by Credit Score: Displays how loan volume varies with credit score for adult borrowers.

🔹Total Loan by Mortgage & Dependency: Assesses dependency and mortgage influence on loan behavior for middle-aged borrowers.

🔹Average Loan (High Credit) by Age & Marital Status: Shows borrowing trends segmented by marital status and age group.

Insight:

🔹Borrowers with higher credit scores and stable marital status (especially married individuals) show better repayment patterns.

🔹Education level and dependency also affect borrowing capacity and credit risk.

3️⃣ Financial Risk Metrics : To assess loan performance, year-over-year changes, and risk segmentation.

Key KPIs & Visuals:

🔹YOY Loan Amount Change by Year: Displays how total loan disbursal fluctuates annually.

🔹YOY Loan Default Change by Year: Tracks yearly changes in default rates to detect high-risk periods.

🔹YTD Loan Amount by Credit Category & Marital Status: Analyzes total disbursal split across credit categories and marital status.

🔹Loan Amount by Income Bracket & Employment: Links borrower income levels with employment type to gauge financial strength.

Insight:

🔹Years like 2015 and 2016 witnessed sharp increases in both loan disbursement and defaults, indicating higher credit exposure.

🔹Medium and high-income borrowers dominate total loan volume, but risk remains uneven across employment categories.

🎯 Enables banking and lending institutions to:

🔹Identify high-risk borrower segments based on employment, age, and credit score.

🔹Optimize loan approval strategies using demographic and income insights.

🔹Monitor default patterns over time to adjust credit policies and risk models.

🔹Enhance decision-making with clear visuals connecting customer profiles to loan outcomes.

🧩 Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can transform raw lending data into actionable financial intelligence.
By combining demographic, income, and credit data, the dashboard provides a 360° view of loan performance, helping institutions reduce default risk, target the right borrowers, and improve portfolio quality.
